# 02-Challenge Portfolio

## Description

I created this portfolio to add the projects I have been working on since I started bootcamp. 

I built this project so I could show potenial employers all the projects I have done. 

This gives me a place to add all the work I complete during bootcamp.

One thing I learned was how to make all the border rights line up. I spent sevral hours trying to figure this out. Once I took a step away it came to me on how to do this. The big leason for me was if i'm stuck on a problem it helps to walk away and clear your mind. After being way from the problem for a few minutes it came to me on how to solve the issue. Moving forward this is a strategy I will be using.
